  firestore-add-documents:
    kind: firestore-add-documents
    source: firestore-source
    description: |
      Adds a new document to a Firestore collection. Please follow the best practices :
       1. Always use typed values in the documentData: Every field must be wrapped with its appropriate type indicator (e.g., {"stringValue": "text"})
       2. Integer values can be strings in the documentData: The tool accepts integer values as strings (e.g., {"integerValue": "1500"})
       3. Use returnData sparingly: Only set to true when you need to verify the exact data that was written
       4. Validate data before sending: Ensure your data matches Firestore's native JSON format
       5. Handle timestamps properly: Use RFC3339 format for timestamp strings
       6. Base64 encode binary data: Binary data must be base64 encoded in the bytesValue field
       7. Consider security rules: Ensure your Firestore security rules allow document creation in the target collection
  firestore-update-document:
    kind: firestore-update-document
    source: firestore-source
    description: |
      Updates an existing document in Firestore. Supports both full document updates and selective field updates using an update mask. Please follow the best practices:
       1. Use update masks for precision: When you only need to update specific fields, use the updateMask parameter to avoid unintended changes
       2. Always use typed values in the documentData: Every field must be wrapped with its appropriate type indicator (e.g., {"stringValue": "text"})
       3. Delete fields using update mask: To delete fields, include them in the updateMask but omit them from documentData
       4. Integer values can be strings: The tool accepts integer values as strings (e.g., {"integerValue": "1500"})
       5. Use returnData sparingly: Only set to true when you need to verify the exact data after the update
       6. Handle timestamps properly: Use RFC3339 format for timestamp strings
       7. Consider security rules: Ensure your Firestore security rules allow document updates
