# AlloyDB for PostgreSQL Source

[AlloyDB for PostgreSQL][alloydb-docs] is a fully-managed, PostgreSQL-compatible
database for demanding transactional workloads. It provides enterprise-grade
performance and availability while maintaining 100% compatibility with
open-source PostgreSQL.

If you are new to AlloyDB for PostgreSQL, you can try [creating and connecting
to a database by following these instructions][alloydb-quickstart].

## Requirements

### IAM Identity

By default, AlloyDB for PostgreSQL source uses the [AlloyDB Go
Connector][alloydb-go-conn] to authorize and establish mTLS connections to your
AlloyDB instance. The Go connector uses your [Application Default Credentials
(ADC)][adc] to authorize your connection to AlloyDB.

In addition to [setting the ADC for your server][set-adc], you need to ensure the
IAM identity has been given the following IAM permissions:

- `roles/alloydb.client`
- `roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageConsumer`

[adc]: https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication#adc
[set-adc]: https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/provide-credentials-adc

### Network Path

Currently, AlloyDB supports connection over both [private IP][private-ip] and
[public IP][public-ip]. Set the `ipType` parameter in your source
configuration to `public` or `private`.

[public-ip]: https://cloud.google.com/alloydb/docs/connect-public-ip

### Database User

Current, this source only uses standard authentication. You will need to [create a
PostreSQL user][alloydb-users] to login to the database with.

## Example

```yaml
sources:
    my-alloydb-pg-source:
        kind: "alloydb-postgres"
        project: "my-project-id"
        region: "us-central1"
        cluster: "my-cluster"
        instance: "my-instance"
        database: "my_db"
        user: "my-user"
        password: "my-password"
```
