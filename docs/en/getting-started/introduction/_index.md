description: An introduction to Gen AI Toolbox for Databases.
---

Gen AI Toolbox for Databases is an open source server that makes it easier to
build Gen AI tools for interacting with databases. It enables you to develop
tools easier, faster, and more securely by handling the complexities such as
connection pooling, authentication, and more.

##  Why Toolbox?

Toolbox helps you build Gen AI tools that let your agents access data in your
database. Toolbox provides:
- **Simplified development**: Integrate tools to your agent in less than 10
- lines of code, reuse tools between multiple agents or frameworks, and deploy
  new versions of tools more easily.
- **Better performance**: Best practices such as connection pooling,
  authentication, and more.
- **Enhanced security**: Integrated auth for more secure access to your data
- **End-to-end observability**: Out of the box metrics and tracing with built-in
  support for OpenTelemetry.


## General Architecture

Toolbox sits between your application's orchestration framework and your
database, providing a control plane that is used to modify, distribute, or
invoke tools. It simplifies the management of your tools by providing you with a
centralized location to store and update tools, allowing you to share tools
between agents and applications and update those tools without necessarily
redeploying your application.

## Getting Started

### Installing the server
For the latest version, check the [releases page][releases] and use the
following instructions for your OS and CPU architecture.

[releases]: https://github.com/googleapis/genai-toolbox/releases

{{< tabpane text=true >}}
{{% tab header="Binary" lang="en" %}}

To install Toolbox as a binary:

```sh
# see releases page for other versions
export VERSION=0.1.0
curl -O https://storage.googleapis.com/genai-toolbox/v$VERSION/linux/amd64/toolbox
chmod +x toolbox
```

{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab header="Container image" lang="en" %}}
You can also install Toolbox as a container:

```sh
# see releases page for other versions
export VERSION=0.1.0
docker pull us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/database-toolbox/toolbox/toolbox:$VERSION
```

{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab header="Compile from source" lang="en" %}}

To install from source, ensure you have the latest version of
[Go installed](https://go.dev/doc/install), and then run the following command:

```sh
go install github.com/googleapis/genai-toolbox@v0.1.0
```

{{% /tab %}}
{{< /tabpane >}}

### Running the server

[Configure](../configure.md) a `tools.yaml` to define your tools, and then
execute `toolbox` to start the server:

```sh
./toolbox --tools_file "tools.yaml"
```

You can use `toolbox help` for a full list of flags! To stop the server, send a
terminate signal (`ctrl+c` on most platforms).

For more detailed documentation on deploying to different environments, check
out the resources in the [How-to section](../../how-to/_index.md)

### Integrating your application

Once your server is up and running, you can load the tools into your
application. See below the list of Client SDKs for using various frameworks:

{{< tabpane text=true >}}
{{% tab header="LangChain" lang="en" %}}

Once you've installed the [Toolbox LangChain
SDK](https://github.com/googleapis/genai-toolbox-langchain-python), you can load
tools:

{{< highlight python >}}
from toolbox_langchain import ToolboxClient

# update the url to point to your server
client = ToolboxClient("http://127.0.0.1:5000")

# these tools can be passed to your application! 
tools = await client.aload_toolset()
{{< /highlight >}}

For more detailed instructions on using the Toolbox LangChain SDK, see the
[project's README](https://github.com/googleapis/genai-toolbox-langchain-python/blob/main/README.md).
