  How to get started running Toolbox locally with Javascript, PostgreSQL, and  [Agent Development Kit](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/),
  [LangGraph](https://www.langchain.com/langgraph), [LlamaIndex](https://www.llamaindex.ai/) or [GoogleGenAI](https://pypi.org/project/google-genai/).

## Before you begin

This guide assumes you have already done the following:

1. Installed [Node.js (v18 or higher)]
2. Installed [PostgreSQL 16+ and the `psql` client][install-postgres]

### Cloud Setup (Optional)

If you plan to use **Google Cloudâ€™s Vertex AI** with your agent (e.g., using Gemini or PaLM models), follow these one-time setup steps:

> ðŸ“š Before you begin:
> - [Install the Google Cloud CLI]
> - [Set up Application Default Credentials (ADC)]

#### Set your project and enable Vertex AI

```bash
gcloud config set project YOUR_PROJECT_ID
gcloud services enable aiplatform.googleapis.com
```

[Node.js (v18 or higher)]: https://nodejs.org/
[install-postgres]: https://www.postgresql.org/download/
[Install the Google Cloud CLI]: https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install
[Set up Application Default Credentials (ADC)]: https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/set-up-adc-local-dev-environment

## Step 1: Set up your database

In this section, we will create a database, insert some data that needs to be
accessed by our agent, and create a database user for Toolbox to connect with.

1. Connect to postgres using the `psql` command:

    ```bash
    psql -h 127.0.0.1 -U postgres
    ```

    Here, `postgres` denotes the default postgres superuser.

    {{< notice info >}}

#### **Having trouble connecting?**

* **Password Prompt:** If you are prompted for a password for the `postgres`
  user and do not know it (or a blank password doesn't work), your PostgreSQL
  installation might require a password or a different authentication method.
* **`FATAL: role "postgres" does not exist`:** This error means the default
  `postgres` superuser role isn't available under that name on your system.
* **`Connection refused`:** Ensure your PostgreSQL server is actually running.
  You can typically check with `sudo systemctl status postgresql` and start it
  with `sudo systemctl start postgresql` on Linux systems.

<br/>

#### **Common Solution**

For password issues or if the `postgres` role seems inaccessible directly, try
switching to the `postgres` operating system user first. This user often has
permission to connect without a password for local connections (this is called
peer authentication).

```bash
sudo -i -u postgres
psql -h 127.0.0.1
```

Once you are in the `psql` shell using this method, you can proceed with the
database creation steps below. Afterwards, type `\q` to exit `psql`, and then
`exit` to return to your normal user shell.

If desired, once connected to `psql` as the `postgres` OS user, you can set a
password for the `postgres` *database* user using: `ALTER USER postgres WITH
PASSWORD 'your_chosen_password';`. This would allow direct connection with `-U
postgres` and a password next time.
    {{< /notice >}}

1. Create a new database and a new user:

    {{< notice tip >}}
  For a real application, it's best to follow the principle of least permission
  and only grant the privileges your application needs.
    {{< /notice >}}

    ```sql
      CREATE USER toolbox_user WITH PASSWORD 'my-password';

      CREATE DATABASE toolbox_db;
      GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE toolbox_db TO toolbox_user;

      ALTER DATABASE toolbox_db OWNER TO toolbox_user;
    ```

1. End the database session:

    ```bash
    \q
    ```

    (If you used `sudo -i -u postgres` and then `psql`, remember you might also
    need to type `exit` after `\q` to leave the `postgres` user's shell
    session.)

1. Connect to your database with your new user:

    ```bash
    psql -h 127.0.0.1 -U toolbox_user -d toolbox_db
    ```

1. Create a table using the following command:

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE hotels(
      id            INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
      name          VARCHAR NOT NULL,
      location      VARCHAR NOT NULL,
      price_tier    VARCHAR NOT NULL,
      checkin_date  DATE    NOT NULL,
      checkout_date DATE    NOT NULL,
      booked        BIT     NOT NULL
    );
    ```

1. Insert data into the table.

    ```sql
    INSERT INTO hotels(id, name, location, price_tier, checkin_date, checkout_date, booked)
    VALUES 
      (1, 'Hilton Basel', 'Basel', 'Luxury', '2024-04-22', '2024-04-20', B'0'),
      (2, 'Marriott Zurich', 'Zurich', 'Upscale', '2024-04-14', '2024-04-21', B'0'),
      (3, 'Hyatt Regency Basel', 'Basel', 'Upper Upscale', '2024-04-02', '2024-04-20', B'0'),
      (4, 'Radisson Blu Lucerne', 'Lucerne', 'Midscale', '2024-04-24', '2024-04-05', B'0'),
      (5, 'Best Western Bern', 'Bern', 'Upper Midscale', '2024-04-23', '2024-04-01', B'0'),
      (6, 'InterContinental Geneva', 'Geneva', 'Luxury', '2024-04-23', '2024-04-28', B'0'),
      (7, 'Sheraton Zurich', 'Zurich', 'Upper Upscale', '2024-04-27', '2024-04-02', B'0'),
      (8, 'Holiday Inn Basel', 'Basel', 'Upper Midscale', '2024-04-24', '2024-04-09', B'0'),
      (9, 'Courtyard Zurich', 'Zurich', 'Upscale', '2024-04-03', '2024-04-13', B'0'),
      (10, 'Comfort Inn Bern', 'Bern', 'Midscale', '2024-04-04', '2024-04-16', B'0');
    ```

1. End the database session:

    ```bash
    \q
    ```

## Step 2: Install and configure Toolbox

In this section, we will download Toolbox, configure our tools in a
`tools.yaml`, and then run the Toolbox server.

1. Download the latest version of Toolbox as a binary:

    {{< notice tip >}}
  Select the
  [correct binary](https://github.com/googleapis/genai-toolbox/releases)
  corresponding to your OS and CPU architecture.
    {{< /notice >}}
    <!-- {x-release-please-start-version} -->
    ```bash
    export OS="linux/amd64" # one of linux/amd64, darwin/arm64, darwin/amd64, or windows/amd64
    curl -O https://storage.googleapis.com/genai-toolbox/v0.8.0/$OS/toolbox
    ```
    <!-- {x-release-please-end} -->

1. Make the binary executable:

    ```bash
    chmod +x toolbox
    ```

1. Write the following into a `tools.yaml` file. Be sure to update any fields
   such as `user`, `password`, or `database` that you may have customized in the
   previous step.

    {{< notice tip >}}
  In practice, use environment variable replacement with the format ${ENV_NAME}
  instead of hardcoding your secrets into the configuration file.

        - update-hotel
        - cancel-hotel
    ```

    For more info on tools, check out the `Resources` section of the docs.

1. Run the Toolbox server, pointing to the `tools.yaml` file created earlier:

    ```bash
    ./toolbox --tools-file "tools.yaml"
    ```
