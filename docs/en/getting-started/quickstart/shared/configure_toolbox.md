<!-- [START configure_toolbox] -->
In this section, we will download Toolbox, configure our tools in a
`tools.yaml`, and then run the Toolbox server.

1. Download the latest version of Toolbox as a binary:

    {{< notice tip >}}
  Select the
  [correct binary](https://github.com/googleapis/genai-toolbox/releases)
  corresponding to your OS and CPU architecture.
    {{< /notice >}}
    <!-- {x-release-please-start-version} -->
    ```bash
    export OS="linux/amd64" # one of linux/amd64, darwin/arm64, darwin/amd64, or windows/amd64
    curl -O https://storage.googleapis.com/genai-toolbox/v0.20.0/$OS/toolbox
    ```
    <!-- {x-release-please-end} -->

1. Make the binary executable:

    ```bash
    chmod +x toolbox
    ```

1. Write the following into a `tools.yaml` file. Be sure to update any fields
   such as `user`, `password`, or `database` that you may have customized in the
   previous step.

    {{< notice tip >}}
  In practice, use environment variable replacement with the format ${ENV_NAME}
  instead of hardcoding your secrets into the configuration file.

    For more info on tools, check out the `Resources` section of the docs.

1. Run the Toolbox server, pointing to the `tools.yaml` file created earlier:

    ```bash
    ./toolbox --tools-file "tools.yaml"
    ```

    {{< notice note >}}
    Toolbox enables dynamic reloading by default. To disable, use the
    `--disable-reload` flag.
