  Javascript SDKs to connect to the MCP Toolbox server.
---

## Overview

The MCP Toolbox service provides a centralized way to manage and expose tools
(like API connectors, database query tools, etc.) for use by GenAI applications.

These JS SDKs act as clients for that service. They handle the communication needed to:

* Fetch tool definitions from your running Toolbox instance.
* Provide convenient JS objects or functions representing those tools.
* Invoke the tools (calling the underlying APIs/services configured in Toolbox).
* Handle authentication and parameter binding as needed.

By using these SDKs, you can easily leverage your Toolbox-managed tools directly
within your JS applications or AI orchestration frameworks.

## Which Package Should I Use?

Choosing the right package depends on how you are building your application:

- [`@toolbox-sdk/core`](https://github.com/googleapis/mcp-toolbox-sdk-js/tree/main/packages/toolbox-core):
  This is a framework agnostic way to connect the tools to popular frameworks
  like Langchain, LlamaIndex and Genkit.
- [`@toolbox-sdk/adk`](https://github.com/googleapis/mcp-toolbox-sdk-js/tree/main/packages/toolbox-adk):
  This package provides a seamless way to connect to [Google ADK TS](https://github.com/google/adk-js).

## Available Packages

This repository hosts the following TS packages. See the package-specific
README for detailed installation and usage instructions:

| Package | Target Use Case | Integration | Path | Details (README) | Npm Version |

## Getting Started

To get started using Toolbox tools with an application, follow these general steps:

1. **Set up and Run the Toolbox Service:**

    Before using the SDKs, you need the main MCP Toolbox service running. Follow
    the instructions here: [**Toolbox Getting Started
    Guide**](https://github.com/googleapis/genai-toolbox?tab=readme-ov-file#getting-started)

2. **Install the Appropriate SDK:**

    Choose the package based on your needs (see "[Which Package Should I Use?](#which-package-should-i-use)" above) and install it:

    ```bash
    # For the core, framework-agnostic SDK
    npm install @toolbox-sdk/core
    ```
