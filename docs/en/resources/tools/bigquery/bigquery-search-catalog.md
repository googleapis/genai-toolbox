## About

A `bigquery-search-catalog` tool returns all entries in Dataplex Catalog (e.g.
tables, views, models) with system=bigquery that matches given user query.
It's compatible with the following sources:

- [bigquery](../../sources/bigquery.md)

`bigquery-search-catalog` takes a required `query` parameter based on which
entries are filtered and returned to the user. It also optionally accepts
following parameters:

- `datasetIds` - The IDs of the bigquery dataset.
- `projectIds` - The IDs of the bigquery project.
- `types` - The type of the data. Accepted values are: CONNECTION, POLICY,
  DATASET, MODEL, ROUTINE, TABLE, VIEW.
- `pageSize` - Number of results in the search page. Defaults to `5`.

## Requirements

### IAM Permissions

Bigquery uses [Identity and Access Management (IAM)][iam-overview] to control
user and group access to Dataplex resources. Toolbox will use your
[Application Default Credentials (ADC)][adc] to authorize and authenticate when
interacting with [Dataplex][dataplex-docs].

In addition to [setting the ADC for your server][set-adc], you need to ensure
the IAM identity has been given the correct IAM permissions for the tasks you
intend to perform. See [Dataplex Universal Catalog IAM permissions][iam-permissions]
and [Dataplex Universal Catalog IAM roles][iam-roles] for more information on
applying IAM permissions and roles to an identity.
