## About

A `bigquery-execute-sql` tool executes a SQL statement against BigQuery.
It's compatible with the following sources:

- [bigquery](../../sources/bigquery.md)

`bigquery-execute-sql` accepts the following parameters:
- **`sql`** (required): The GoogleSQL statement to execute.
- **`dry_run`** (optional): If set to `true`, the query is validated but not run,
  returning information about the execution instead. Defaults to `false`.

The behavior of this tool is influenced by the `writeMode` setting on its `bigquery` source:

- **`allowed` (default):** All SQL statements are permitted.
- **`blocked`:** Only `SELECT` statements are allowed. Any other type of statement (e.g., `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `CREATE`) will be rejected.
- **`protected`:** This mode enables session-based execution. `SELECT` statements can be used on all tables, while write operations are allowed only for the session's temporary dataset (e.g., `CREATE TEMP TABLE ...`). This prevents modifications to permanent datasets while allowing stateful, multi-step operations within a secure session.

The tool's behavior is influenced by the `allowedDatasets` restriction on the
`bigquery` source. Similar to `writeMode`, this setting provides an additional layer of security by controlling which datasets can be accessed:

- **Without `allowedDatasets` restriction:** The tool can execute any valid GoogleSQL
  query.
- **With `allowedDatasets` restriction:** Before execution, the tool performs a dry run
  to analyze the query.
  It will reject the query if it attempts to access any table outside the
  allowed `datasets` list. To enforce this restriction, the following operations
  are also disallowed:
  - **Dataset-level operations** (e.g., `CREATE SCHEMA`, `ALTER SCHEMA`).
  - **Unanalyzable operations** where the accessed tables cannot be determined
    statically (e.g., `EXECUTE IMMEDIATE`, `CREATE PROCEDURE`, `CALL`).

> **Note:** This tool is intended for developer assistant workflows with human-in-the-loop and shouldn't be used for production agents.

## Example

```yaml
tools:
 execute_sql_tool:
    kind: bigquery-execute-sql
