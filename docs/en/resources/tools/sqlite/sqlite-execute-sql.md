## About

A `sqlite-execute-sql` tool executes a single SQL statement against a SQLite
database. It's compatible with any of the following sources:

- [sqlite](../../sources/sqlite.md)

This tool is designed for direct execution of SQL statements. It takes a single
`sql` input parameter and runs the SQL statement against the configured SQLite
`source`.

> **Note:** This tool is intended for developer assistant workflows with
> human-in-the-loop and shouldn't be used for production agents.

## Example

```yaml
tools:
 execute_sql_tool:
    kind: sqlite-execute-sql
    source: my-sqlite-db
    description: Use this tool to execute a SQL statement.
```
