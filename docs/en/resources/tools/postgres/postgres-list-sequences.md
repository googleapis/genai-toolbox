## About

The `postgres-list-sequences` tool retrieves information about sequences in a Postgres database. It's compatible with any of the following sources:

- [alloydb-postgres](../../sources/alloydb-pg.md)
- [cloud-sql-postgres](../../sources/cloud-sql-pg.md)
- [postgres](../../sources/postgres.md)

`postgres-list-sequences` lists detailed information as JSON for all sequences. The tool does not take any innput parameters.

## Example

```yaml
tools:
  list_indexes:
    kind: postgres-list-sequences
    source: postgres-source
    description: |
        Lists all the sequences in the database ordered by sequence name.
        Returns sequence name, schema name, sequence owner, data type of the
        sequence, starting value, minimum value, maximum value of the sequence,
        the value by which the sequence is incremented, and the last value
        generated by generated by the sequence in the current session.
```

The response is a json array with the following elements:
```json
{
    "sequencename": "sequence name",
    "schemaname": "schema name",
    "sequenceowner": "owner of the sequence",
    "data_type": "data type of the sequence",
    "start_value": "starting value of the sequence",
    "min_value": "minimum value of the sequence",
    "max_value": "maximum value of the sequence",
    "increment_by": "increment value of the sequence",
    "last_value": "last value of the sequence"
}
```
