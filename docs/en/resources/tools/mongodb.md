## About

The "mongodb" tool executes a find and vector query on MongoDB based on the operation set by the user.
It's compatible with any of the following sources:

- [mongodb](../sources/mongodb.md)


The specified query statement is executed on mongodb based on the parameters passed,
and specified parameters will inserted according to their position: e.g. `1`
will be the first parameter specified, `$@` will be the second parameter, and so
on.


## Example

```yaml
tools:
  search-movie-by-name:
    kind: "mongodb-atlas"
    source: "my-mongo-db"
    description: "Search for movies based on name."
    collection: "movies"
    operation: "find"
    parameters:
      - name: title
        type: string
        description: Name of the movie
    query:
      title: "$1"
  aggregate-products:
    kind: "mongodb-atlas"
    source: "my-mongo-db"
    description: "Run an aggregation pipeline on the movies collection."
    collection: "movies"
    operation: "vectorSearch"
    parameters:
      - name: indexName
        type: string
        description: "The name of the index to use for vector search."
      - name: embeddings
        type: array
        description: array of embedding generated by user for the input statement.
        items:
          name: name
          type: float
          description: the data in the array represents the dimension of the vector
      - name: path
        type: string
        description: "The path to the field to search."
    query:
      indexName: "$1"
      embeddings: "$2"
      path: "$3"
