  Custom prompts defined by the user.

Custom prompts are defined by the user to be exposed through their MCP server.
They are the `default` type for prompts.

## Examples

### Basic Prompt

Here is an example of a simple prompt that takes a single argument, code, and
asks an LLM to review it.

```yaml
prompts:
  code_review:
    description: "Asks the LLM to analyze code quality and suggest improvements."
    messages:
      - content: "Please review the following code for quality, correctness, and potential improvements: \n\n{{.code}}"
    arguments:
      - name: "code"
        description: "The code to review"
```

### Multi-message prompt

You can define prompts with multiple messages to set up more complex
conversational contexts, like a role-playing scenario.

```yaml
prompts:
  roleplay_scenario:
    description: "Sets up a roleplaying scenario with initial messages."
    arguments:
      - name: "character"
        description: "The character the AI should embody."
      - name: "situation"
        description: "The initial situation for the roleplay."
    messages:
      - role: "user"
        content: "Let's roleplay. You are {{.character}}. The situation is: {{.situation}}"
      - role: "assistant"
        content: "Okay, I understand. I am ready. What happens next?"
```
