# Google OAuth 2.0

To use Google as your Toolbox authentication provider, you could integrate
Google sign-in into your application by following this
[guide](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/web/sign-in). After
setting up the Google sign-in workflow, you should have registered your
application and retrieved a [Client
ID](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/web/sign-in#create_authorization_credentials).
Configure your auth source in `tools.yaml` with the `Client ID`.

## Example

```yaml
authSources:
  my-google-auth:
    kind: google
    clientId: YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID
```
