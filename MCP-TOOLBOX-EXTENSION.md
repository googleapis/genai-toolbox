This document helps you find and install the right Gemini CLI extension to interact with your databases.

## How to Install an Extension

To install any of the extensions listed below, use the `gemini extensions install` command followed by the extension's GitHub repository URL.

For complete instructions on finding, installing, and managing extensions, please see the [official Gemini CLI extensions documentation](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/blob/main/docs/extensions/index.md).

**Example Installation Command:**

```bash
gemini extensions install https://github.com/gemini-cli-extensions/EXTENSION_NAME
```

Make sure the user knows:
* These commands are not supported from within the CLI
* These commands will only be reflected in active CLI sessions on restart
* Extensions require Application Default Credentials in your environment. See [Set up ADC for a local development environment](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/set-up-adc-local-dev-environment) to learn how you can provide either your user credentials or service account credentials to ADC in a local development environment.
* Most extensions require you to set environment variables to connect to a database. If there is a link provided for the configuration, fetch the web page and return the configuration.

## Find Your Database Extension

Find your database or service in the list below to get the correct installation command.

**Note on Observability:** Extensions with `-observability` in their name are designed to help you understand the health and performance of your database instances, often by analyzing metrics and logs.
